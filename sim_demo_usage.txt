# sim_demo.sh usage

Run the encrypted payment notes demo with different zkVM backends:

## Usage:
./sim_demo.sh [backend]

## Backends:
- risc0 (default) - RISC0 zkVM backend
- sp1            - SP1 zkVM backend

## Examples:
./sim_demo.sh           # uses risc0 (default)
./sim_demo.sh risc0     # explicitly use risc0
./sim_demo.sh sp1       # use sp1 backend

## What it does:
1. Builds binary with selected backend if not found
2. Initializes simulator
3. Creates wallets (alice, bob, and charlie)
4. Funds alice with 3000 mojos
5. Alice sends 1000 to bob (500 + 500 in two transactions)
6. Bob scans and receives encrypted notes
7. Bob sends 200 back to alice
8. Funds charlie with 1500 mojos
9. Demonstrates unlinkable offers (alice creates offer, charlie takes it)
10. Shows final balances and saved proofs

## Output:
- All proofs saved to simulator_data/state.json
- Persistent blockchain state (merkle tree + nullifier set)
- View with: ./target/release/clvm-zk sim status
- View proofs: ./target/release/clvm-zk sim proofs
